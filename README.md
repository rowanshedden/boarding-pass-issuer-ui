AACO demonstrator reference code Web App

The SITA Boarding Pass Issuer Web App is a single-page app (SPA) for organizations who issue and verify self-sovereign identity (SSI) credentials via an Aries cloud agent (such as [ACA-Py](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python)). This app provides a friendly UI for end-users that can be easily deployed to a private or public cloud and accessed from any modern web browser.

For an introduction to self-sovereign identity (SSI), please see [Phil Windley's article](https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/09/multi-source_and_self-sovereign_identity.shtml) on the topic.
